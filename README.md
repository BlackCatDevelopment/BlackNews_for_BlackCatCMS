BlackNews for Black Cat CMS
===============================

This is a module for Black Cat CMS. It provides the opportunity to add a news page/ blog etc.

It supports permalinks, variants and RSS.

BlackNews 0.2 requires BlackCat 1.0.2 or higher.

If you use 1.0.1 you can simply modify the /framework/CAT/Helper/Addons.php by adding the value 'module_variants' to $info_vars_full['module']. You also need to set the Version in the precheck.php to 1.0.1!

Please note that this is still work in progress!
